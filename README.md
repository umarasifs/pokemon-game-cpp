# Pokemon Battle Simulator Game (C++)
A text based (console) Pokemon battle simulator

## Features
The user is able to:
<br>
* Simulate a 2-player Pokemon game
* Give themselves a name
* Choose 6 Pokemon
* Choose to fight or switch during any given turn
* Play multiple games back to back


## Future Proofing
Many design decisions were conciously chosen during programming:
* Pokemon, moves, and types read from text files. This allows more characters to be added at any further date
* Structured file system. With multiple sprites and resources, the files are organized such that adding more characters is simple
